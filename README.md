# Functional Outlook Automation Demo with Python
This project demonstrates how to automate basic email management tasks in Outlook using Python and the `pywin32` library.

## What does the script do?
- Establishes a connection to Outlook via COM.
- Filters items to work only with real email messages.
- Extracts key information (sender, subject, received time).
- Logs all activity in a `log.txt` file for traceability and easier maintenance.

## Optional features (easy to add)
This script can be easily extended to include features such as:

- Filtering by subject or keywords.
- Detecting if emails were replied to or not.
- Saving pending emails to `.xlsx` or `.csv` files.
- Automatically sending follow-up messages after X days.
## Ideal for:

- Automating repetitive email tasks in corporate environments.
- Implementing follow-up workflows with clients.
- Boosting personal or team productivity.
